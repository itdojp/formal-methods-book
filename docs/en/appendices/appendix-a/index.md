# Appendix A: Refresher on Mathematical Foundations

This appendix collects the minimum set of mathematical notation that appears repeatedly in this book as a quick reference. It is not intended to be a full set of lecture notes. It is a cheat sheet for reading the main chapters and writing specifications, especially Chapter 4 on Alloy, Chapter 5 on Z, Chapter 6 on CSP, and Chapter 7 on TLA+.

Notation differs across traditions and tools even when the underlying concept is the same. To avoid inconsistent notation inside this book, also refer to Appendix C, which provides a notation cross-reference.

## A.1 Sets

A set represents a collection of elements. In specification writing, sets are the basic unit used to represent states and the range of values that are allowed.

Common symbols:
- Membership: `x ∈ A` (`x` is an element of `A`), `x ∉ A`
- Subset: `A ⊆ B` (`A` is included in `B`), `A ⊂ B` (proper subset)
- Empty set: `∅`
- Set operations: `A ∪ B` (union), `A ∩ B` (intersection), `A \ B` (difference)
- Power set: `ℙ X` (the set of all subsets of `X`)
- Cartesian product: `X × Y` (the set of ordered pairs)
- Cardinality: `#A` (the number of elements in `A`)

Example:
```text
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4}

1 ∈ A
A ∩ B = {3}
A \ B = {1, 2}
```

## A.2 Logic

Constraints in specifications are written as logical formulas, including invariants, preconditions, and postconditions.

Connectives, which combine propositions:
- Negation: `¬P` (not `P`)
- Conjunction: `P ∧ Q` (`P` and `Q`)
- Disjunction: `P ∨ Q` (`P` or `Q`)
- Implication: `P ⇒ Q` (if `P`, then `Q`)
- Equivalence: `P ⇔ Q` (`P` and `Q` are equivalent)

Quantifiers, which express “for all” and “there exists”:
- Universal quantification: `∀x : X • P(x)` (for every `x` in `X`, `P(x)` holds)
- Existential quantification: `∃x : X • P(x)` (there exists some `x` in `X` such that `P(x)` holds)

Example: “The balance of every account is non-negative.”
```text
∀a : Account • balance(a) ≥ 0
```

## A.3 Relations and Functions

A relation represents a correspondence between elements of two sets. A mapping, or function, is a special case of a relation.

### Relations

A relation `R` can be understood as a subset of `X × Y`:
```text
R ⊆ X × Y
```

In Z notation, the following type is used:
- `R : X ↔ Y` (a relation between `X` and `Y`)

Common operations:
- Domain: `dom R` (the elements that appear on the `X` side)
- Range: `ran R` (the elements that appear on the `Y` side)

### Functions

A mapping, or function, is a relation in which each input has a unique output.

In this book, the following minimum set is used:
- Total function: `f : X → Y` (a value is defined for every element of `X`)
- Partial function: `f : X ⇸ Y` (the value may be undefined for some elements)

Example: some books do not have a due date assigned.
```text
dueDate : Book ⇸ Date
```

## A.4 State, Operations, and Invariants

In specifications, the state and the operations are described separately.

A minimal picture:
- State: the data held by the system, such as sets, relations, and functions
- Invariant: a constraint that must always hold
- Operation: a procedure that updates the state, described with preconditions, postconditions, and frame conditions

Example: a conceptual view of a bank-account constraint
```text
State: balance : Account → Int
Invariant: ∀a : Account • balance(a) ≥ 0
Operation: withdraw(a, amount)
  Pre: amount > 0 ∧ balance(a) ≥ amount
  Post: balance'(a) = balance(a) - amount
```

## A.5 Equivalence Relations and Induction (Minimum Required)

### Equivalence relations

An equivalence relation `~` is a relation that satisfies the following three properties:
- Reflexivity: `∀x • x ~ x`
- Symmetry: `∀x, y • x ~ y ⇒ y ~ x`
- Transitivity: `∀x, y, z • x ~ y ∧ y ~ z ⇒ x ~ z`

Equivalence relations are used when we want to treat multiple things as “the same,” for example when dealing with identifiers, normalization, or abstraction.

### Induction

Induction is a basic method for proving properties over natural numbers or over steps in a sequence. In its minimal form, it has two stages:
1. Base case: show `P(0)`
2. Inductive step: show `P(n) ⇒ P(n+1)`

In discussions of state transitions, induction is useful as an auxiliary line of reasoning when explaining invariants in the form “it holds up to step `n`, therefore it also holds at step `n+1`.”
