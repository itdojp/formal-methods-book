# Appendix C: Notation Cross-Reference

> Translation status: full draft  
> Japanese source of truth: `src/ja/appendices/appendix-c.md`

This appendix collects the minimum set of frequently used terms and symbols in formal methods together with the Definition of Done checklist for the AI era.

## C.1 Glossary

- **invariant**: a property that must always hold. If a counterexample appears, it indicates a breakdown in the specification or the implementation.
- **safety**: a property stating that something bad does not happen, for example that a double withdrawal never occurs.
- **liveness**: a property stating that something good eventually happens, for example that a request is eventually processed.
- **refinement**: the process of making an abstract specification progressively more concrete until it reaches an implementation-level specification.
- **contract**: a runtime or verification-time guard that makes preconditions and postconditions explicit.
- **trace**: a sequence of state transitions. Counterexamples are presented as traces.
- **counterexample**: a minimal execution that violates a property. It is the starting point for correcting the design.

## C.2 Definition of Done Checklist for the AI Era

In AI-assisted development, the premise is that the correctness of outputs is backed by verifiers.

- If there is a change in the specification, the corresponding formal specification has also been updated
- Verification logs include the seed, depth, scope, and execution command
- If a counterexample appears, the fix history and re-verification logs remain available
- The reason for any exception approval, the fallback measure, and the follow-up deadline are stated explicitly

## C.3 Notation Cross-Reference (Z / Alloy / CSP / TLA+)

The following table gives a minimum correspondence for how the same concept is expressed in each notation. Entries are limited to what is consistent with the chapter-level notation used in this book, especially Chapter 4 on Alloy, Chapter 5 on Z, Chapter 6 on CSP, and Chapter 7 on TLA+.

Code-block labels:
- **Tool-compliant blocks**: notation intended to be copied directly into a tool or CLI and executed as-is, although extra configuration may still be required depending on the environment.
- **Context-dependent snippets**: syntax that follows a real tool, but is only a fragment and therefore requires declarations, a model, a harness, or an interactive context elsewhere.
- **Pseudo-notation blocks**: notation used for explanation that may contain mathematical notation, omitted detail, or output examples and therefore is not guaranteed to be strict tool input.

The actual block lines in this repository use the canonical labels enforced by the linter.

Notes:
- Inside a tool-compliant block, include only strings that are valid as tool input. Do not mix in output examples, diagrams, or natural-language explanation.
- If mandatory surrounding elements such as variable declarations, `MODULE main`, a verification harness, or an interactive context are defined elsewhere, use a context-dependent snippet.
- If the surrounding mandatory elements are explicitly identified in the text or a referenced location, the fragment is treated as a context-dependent snippet. If references are not identified or the fragment includes mathematical notation, omission, or natural language, it is treated as pseudo-notation.
- Diagrams, output examples, and pseudocode should use pseudo-notation.

### C.3.1 Concept Correspondence (Minimum Set)

| Concept | Z notation (in this book) | Alloy (assuming Alloy Analyzer 6) | CSP (in this book / tools) | TLA+ (assuming TLC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Set (type) | `A : ℙ X` | `A: set X` | Event set `{a, b}` / synchronization set `X` | `A ∈ SUBSET X` |
| Membership | `x ∈ A` | `x in A` | Event membership `a ∈ X` | `x ∈ A` |
| Relation | `R : X ↔ Y` | `R: X -> Y` | Usually not written directly | `R ⊆ X × Y` |
| Total function | `f : X → Y` | `f: X -> one Y` | Usually not written directly | `f ∈ [X -> Y]` |
| Partial function | `f : X ⇸ Y` | `f: X -> lone Y` | Usually not written directly | Expressed as a partial function where needed |
| State | State schema | Model time or steps explicitly | Process, with state embedded in transitions | Variable `v` and next-state value `v'` |
| Initial state | `InitState` | `pred Init[...]` | Initial process `P0` | `Init == ...` |
| Transition / operation | `ΔState` | `pred Step[s, s']` | Prefix `a → P` (`a -> P` in tools) | `Next == ...` |
| Invariant (safety) | Schema constraint | `fact` / `assert` | Refinement / assertions, depending on the tool | `Invariant == ...` / `[]P` |
| Liveness / fairness | Requires extension | Expressed over traces | Tool-dependent | `<>P`, `WF_vars(A)`, `SF_vars(A)` |

Notes:
- Z symbols such as `↔`, `→`, `⇸`, and `↦` follow the notation system used in Chapter 5.
- In the prose of this book, CSP uses mathematical symbols such as `→`, `□`, and `⊓`, while tools such as `FDR`/`CSPM` typically use `->`, `[]`, and `|~|`.

### C.3.2 Z Notation: Main Symbols and Reading Guide

| Symbol | Meaning | Example reading |
|---|---|---|
| `ℙ X` | Power set | power set of `X` |
| `x ∈ A` | Membership | `x` is in `A` |
| `R : X ↔ Y` | Relation | relation from `X` to `Y` |
| `f : X → Y` | Total function | total function from `X` to `Y` |
| `f : X ⇸ Y` | Partial function | partial function from `X` to `Y` |
| `x ↦ y` | Maplet, that is, a pair | `x` maps to `y` |
| `dom R`, `ran R` | Domain / range | domain / range |

### C.3.3 Alloy: Main Symbols (Alloy Analyzer 6)

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `sig` / field | Sets and relations | `sig User { files: set File }` |
| Multiplicity `one` / `lone` / `some` / `set` | Cardinality constraint | `owner: one User` |
| `fact` | Constraint that always holds | `fact { ... }` |
| `assert` + `check` | Property checking through counterexample search | `check Inv for 5` |
| `run` | Search for satisfying instances | `run { ... } for 5` |
| `.`, `~`, `^` | Join / transpose / transitive closure | `u.files`, `~r`, `^parent` |

### C.3.4 CSP: Main Symbols (Book / Tools)

| Concept | Book notation (mathematical) | Tool notation (representative CSPM/FDR form) |
|---|---|---|
| Prefix | `a → P` | `a -> P` |
| External choice | `P □ Q` | `P [] Q` |
| Internal choice | `P ⊓ Q` | <code>P &#124;~&#124; Q</code> |
| Synchronous parallel with synchronization set `X` | <code>P [&#124; X &#124;] Q</code> | <code>P [&#124; X &#124;] Q</code> |
| Interleaving | <code>P &#124;&#124;&#124; Q</code> | <code>P &#124;&#124;&#124; Q</code> |
| Hiding | `P \ X` | `P \\ X` |
| Renaming | `P[[ a ← b ]]` | `P[[ a <- b ]]` |

Note: the tool notation shown here is representative only. In actual work, confirm the details against the specific tool and CSP dialect in use.

### C.3.5 TLA+: Main Symbols (TLC)

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `v'` | The next-state value | `x' = x + 1` |
| `[]P` / `<>P` | Always / eventually | `[]Inv`, `<>Goal` |
| `WF_vars(A)` / `SF_vars(A)` | Fairness assumptions | `WF_vars(Next)` |
| `.cfg` | TLC configuration | initial state, invariants, and exploration constraints |

Supplement:
- Alloy is centered on finite-scope counterexample search. When modeling state transitions, time or steps are usually made explicit.
- TLA+ is centered on state transitions and temporal logic. It is typically used to fix high-level properties such as invariants and liveness before implementation detail is fully developed.
- Z is used to make requirements precise through state and operation schemas and then refine them toward implementation.
